<meta name="description" content="In this post we will learn about some basic differences betweeen JDBC and Hibernate that we usually use in our project for interaction with relational Database WHAT IS THE JDBC? WHAT IS THE HIBERNATE? SOME DIFFERENCIES BETWEEN JDBC AND HIBERNATE WHAT IS THE JDBC? JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity. JDBC is a Java API to connect and execute the query with the database. It is a part of JavaSE (Java Standard Edition). JDBC API uses JDBC drivers to connect with the database. We can use JDBC API to access tabular data stored in any relational database. By the help of JDBC API, we can save, update, delete and fetch data from the database. The JDBC interface consists of two layers: The JDBC API supports communication between the Java application and the JDBC manager. The JDBC driver supports communication between the JDBC manager and the database driver. JDBC is the common API that your application code interacts with. Beneath that is the JDBC-compliant driver for the database you are using. More information WHAT IS THE HIBERNATE? Hibernate is an open-source, non-invasive, light-weight java ORM(Object-relational mapping) framework to develop objects which are independent of the database software and make independent persistence logic in all JAVA, JEE. It simplifies the interaction of java applications with databases. Hibernate is an implementation of JPA(Java Persistence API). Hibernate maps Java classes to database tables and from Java data types to SQL data types and relieves the developer from 95% of common data persistence related programming tasks. Hibernate sits between traditional Java objects and database server to handle all the works in persisting those objects based on the appropriate O/R mechanisms and patterns. More information SOME DIFFERENCIES BETWEEN JDBC AND HIBERNATE NO JDBC HIBERNATE 1. In JDBC, one needs to write code to map the object model’s data representation to the schema of the relational model. Hibernate maps the object model’s data to the schema of the database itself with the help of annotations. 2. JDBC enables developers to create queries and update data to a relational database using the Structured Query Language (SQL). Hibernate uses HQL (Hibernate Query Language) which is similar to SQL but understands object-oriented concepts like inheritance, association etc. 3. JDBC code needs to be written in a try catch block as it throws checked exception(SQLexception). Whereas Hibernate manages the exceptions itself by marking them as unchecked. 4. JDBC is database dependent i.e. one needs to write different codes for different database. Whereas Hibernate is database independent and same code can work for many databases with minor changes. 5. Creating associations between relations is quite hard in JDBC. Associations like one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many can be acquired easily with the help of annotations.
