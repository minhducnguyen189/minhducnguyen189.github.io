WHAT IS THE DOCKER-COMPOSE ? INSTALL DOCKER ALL DOCKER COMMANDS AND DESCRIPTIONS ALL DOCKERFILE COMMAND DESCRIPTION WHAT IS THE DOCKER? Docker is a container management service. The keywords of Docker are develop, ship and run anywhere. The whole idea of Docker is for developers to easily develop applications, ship them into containers which can then be deployed anywhere. The initial release of Docker was in March 2013 and since then, it has become the buzzword for modern world development, especially in the face of Agile-based projects. More Information DOCKER COMPONENTS Docker contains some main components as below Docker for Windows − It allows one to run Docker containers on the Windows OS. We also have docker for Linux and MacOS. Docker Engine − It is used for building Docker images and creating Docker containers. It is the heart of Docker. Docker Hub − This is the registry which is used to host various Docker images. Docker Compose − This is used to define applications using multiple Docker containers. WHAT IS THE DOCKER ENGINE ? The Docker engine is an open-source software designed to build and run applications in isolated environments known as containers. It uses OS-level virtualization to run the applications. This is similar to virtual machines but the Docker engine offers a more resource-friendly and portable environment to our processes. Developed by Docker.Inc under the Apache License, the Docker engine hosts images, networks, and containers through a server-side daemon process. Since its initial release in 2013, Docker has grown massively in demand and reputation. WHAT IS THE DOCKER CONTAINER ? A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. Container images (docker images) become containers at runtime and in the case of Docker images become containers when they run on Docker Engine. More information WHAT IS THE DOCKER IMAGES ? A Docker image is a file used to execute code in a Docker container. Docker images act as a set of instructions to build a Docker container, like a template. Docker images also act as the starting point when using Docker. An image is comparable to a snapshot in virtual machine (VM) environments Docker Engine is used to create, run and deploy applications in containers. A Docker image contains application code, libraries, tools, dependencies and other files needed to make an application run. When a user runs an image, it can become one or many instances of a container. More indormation Example of a docker image to run a spring boot project #get docker image with openjdk 8 installed from docker hub FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine #expose port 8080 to real machine EXPOSE 8080 #some information for docker image LABEL owner=&quot;duc&quot; LABEL maintainer=&quot;minhducnguyen189@gmail.com&quot; LABEL description=&quot;test image my project&quot; #copy the jar file in target folder into docker image COPY target/my-project-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar my-project-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar #run command java to run jar package when docker image is run ENTRYPOINT [&quot;java&quot;,&quot;-jar&quot;,&quot;/my-project-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar&quot;] run command docker build . --tag myproject to build a docker image with name myproject run command docker run -it -p8080:8080 myproject to run a docker cotainer with 8080 is mapped out side to real machine. WHAT IS THE DOCKER HUB ? Docker Hub is a service provided by Docker for finding and sharing container images with your team. It is the world’s largest repository of container images with an array of content sources including container community developers, open source projects and independent software vendors (ISV) building and distributing their code in containers. Users get access to free public repositories for storing and sharing images or can choose a subscription plan for private repositories. More information WHAT IS THE DOCKER-COMPOSE ? Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Docker Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command docker-compose up, you create and start all the services from your configuration. Using Compose is basically a three-step process: Define your app’s environment with a Dockerfile so it can be reproduced anywhere. Define the services that make up your app in docker-compose.yml so they can be run together in an isolated environment. Run docker-compose up and the Docker compose command starts and runs your entire app. You can alternatively run docker-compose up using the docker-compose binary. An docker-compose.yml is like the example below. In this example we can see that we have 2 services, one is the mysql_db_container which is using image mysql:latest from the docker hub. The second one is the adminer_container which is using the image adminer:latest from the docker hub also version: &#39;3.7&#39; services: mysql_db_container: image: mysql:latest command: --default-authentication-plugin=mysql_native_password environment: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password MYSQL_DATABASE: todo ports: - 3306:3306 volumes: - ./mysql:/var/lib/mysql:rw adminer_container: image: adminer:latest environment: ADMINER_DEFAULT_SERVER: mysql_db_container ports: - 9090:8080 More information INSTALL DOCKER Go to link below to download and install as default: Download Link ALL DOCKER COMMANDS AND DESCRIPTIONS Command Description docker attach Attach local standard input, output, and error streams to a running container docker build Build an image from a Dockerfile docker builder Manage builds docker checkpoint Manage checkpoints docker commit Create a new image from a container’s changes docker config Manage Docker configs docker container Manage containers docker context Manage contexts docker cp Copy files/folders between a container and the local filesystem docker create Create a new container docker diff Inspect changes to files or directories on a container’s filesystem docker events Get real time events from the server docker exec Run a command in a running container docker export Export a container’s filesystem as a tar archive docker history Show the history of an image docker image Manage images docker images List images docker import Import the contents from a tarball to create a filesystem image docker info Display system-wide information docker inspect Return low-level information on Docker objects docker kill Kill one or more running containers docker load Load an image from a tar archive or STDIN docker login Log in to a Docker registry docker logout Log out from a Docker registry docker logs Fetch the logs of a container docker manifest Manage Docker image manifests and manifest lists docker network Manage networks docker node Manage Swarm nodes docker pause Pause all processes within one or more containers docker plugin Manage plugins docker port List port mappings or a specific mapping for the container docker ps List containers docker pull Pull an image or a repository from a registry docker push Push an image or a repository to a registry docker rename Rename a container docker restart Restart one or more containers docker rm Remove one or more containers docker rmi Remove one or more images docker run Run a command in a new container docker save Save one or more images to a tar archive (streamed to STDOUT by default) docker search Search the Docker Hub for images docker secret Manage Docker secrets docker service Manage services docker stack Manage Docker stacks docker start Start one or more stopped containers docker stats Display a live stream of container(s) resource usage statistics docker stop Stop one or more running containers docker swarm Manage Swarm docker system Manage Docker docker tag Create a tag TARGET_IMAGE that refers to SOURCE_IMAGE docker top Display the running processes of a container docker trust Manage trust on Docker images docker unpause Unpause all processes within one or more containers docker update Update configuration of one or more containers docker version Show the Docker version information docker volume Manage volumes docker wait Block until one or more containers stop, then print their exit codes ALL DOCKERFILE COMMAND DESCRIPTION Commands Description FROM Sets the base image for subsequent MAINTAINER Sets the author field of the generated images RUN Execute commands in a new layer on top of the current image and commit the results CMD Allowed only once (if many then last one takes effect) LABEL Adds metadata to an image EXPOSE Informs container runtime that the container listens on the specified network ports at runtime ENV Sets an environment variable ADD Copy new files, directories, or remote file URLs from into the filesystem of the container COPY Copy new files or directories into the filesystem of the container ENTRYPOINT Allows you to configure a container that will run as an executable VOLUME Creates a mount point and marks it as holding externally mounted volumes from native host or other containers USER Sets the username or UID to use when running the image WORKDIR Sets the working directory for any RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY, and ADD commands ARG Defines a variable that users can pass at build-time to the builder using –build-arg ONBUILD Adds an instruction to be executed later, when the image is used as the base for another build STOPSIGNAL Sets the system call signal that will be sent to the container to exit you can view more docker script in this link docker file script" />

<h2 id="what-is-the-docker">WHAT IS THE DOCKER?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Docker is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a container management service</code>. The keywords of Docker are <strong>develop</strong>, <strong>ship</strong> and <strong>run</strong> anywhere. The whole idea of Docker is for developers to easily develop applications, ship them into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">containers</code> which can then be deployed anywhere.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The initial release of Docker was in March 2013 and since then, it has become the buzzword for modern world development, especially in the face of Agile-based projects.</p>
  </li>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="docker-components">DOCKER COMPONENTS</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Docker contains some main components as below</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Docker for Windows</code> − It allows one to run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Docker containers</code> on the Windows OS. We also have docker for Linux and MacOS.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Docker Engine</code> − It is used for building <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Docker images</code> and creating <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Docker containers</code>. It is the heart of Docker.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Docker Hub</code> − This is the registry which is used to host various <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Docker images</code>.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Docker Compose</code> − This is used to define applications using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">multiple Docker containers</code>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-the-docker-engine-">WHAT IS THE DOCKER ENGINE ?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">The Docker engine</code> is an open-source software designed to <strong>build and run applications in isolated environments known as containers</strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It uses OS-level virtualization to run the applications. This is similar to virtual machines but the Docker engine offers a more resource-friendly and portable environment to our processes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Developed by Docker.Inc under the Apache License, the Docker engine hosts <strong>images, networks, and containers</strong> through a server-side daemon process. Since its initial release in 2013, Docker has grown massively in demand and reputation.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-the-docker-container-">WHAT IS THE DOCKER CONTAINER ?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A container</code> is a standard <strong>unit of software</strong> that <strong>packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably</strong> from one computing environment to another. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A Docker container image</code> is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that <strong>includes everything needed to run an application</strong>: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Container images (docker images)</code> become <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">containers</code> <strong>at runtime</strong> and in the case of Docker images <strong>become containers</strong> when they run on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Docker Engine</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>

<h2 id="what-is-the-docker-images-">WHAT IS THE DOCKER IMAGES ?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Docker image</code> is a <strong>file</strong> used to <strong>execute code</strong> in a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Docker container</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Docker images</code> act as a <strong>set of instructions</strong> to build a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Docker container</code>, like a template. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Docker images</code> also act as the <strong>starting point</strong> when using Docker. An image is comparable to <strong>a snapshot in virtual machine (VM) environments</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Docker Engine is used to <strong>create, run and deploy applications</strong> in containers. A <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Docker image</code> contains <strong>application code, libraries, tools, dependencies and other files</strong> needed to make an application run. When a user runs an image, it can become one or many instances of a container.</p>

    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-the-docker-hub-">WHAT IS THE DOCKER HUB ?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Docker Hub</code> is a service provided by Docker for <strong>finding and sharing container images</strong> with your team. It is <strong>the world’s largest repository of container images</strong> with an array of content sources including container community developers, open source projects and independent software vendors (ISV) building and distributing their code in containers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Users get access to free public repositories for storing and sharing images or can choose a subscription plan for private repositories.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/">More information</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-is-the-docker-compose-">WHAT IS THE DOCKER-COMPOSE ?</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Docker Compose</code> is a tool for <strong>defining and running multi-container Docker applications</strong>. With Docker Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your application’s services. Then, with a single command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker-compose up</code>, you create and start all the services from your configuration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Using Compose is basically a three-step process:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Define your app’s environment with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Dockerfile</code> so it can be reproduced anywhere.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Define the services that make up your app in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker-compose.yml</code> so they can be run together in an isolated environment.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker-compose</code> up and the Docker compose command starts and runs your entire app. You can alternatively run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">docker-compose up</code> using the docker-compose binary.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An docker-compose.yml is like the example below. In this example we can see that we have 2 services, one is the <strong>mysql_db_container</strong> which is using image <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mysql:latest</code> from the <strong>docker hub</strong>. The second one is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">adminer_container</code> which is using the image <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">adminer:latest</code> from the <strong>docker hub</strong> also</p>
